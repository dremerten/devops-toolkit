# cert-manager ClusterIssuer Configuration
#
# This file is a TEMPLATE that uses environment variables.
# Do NOT apply directly with kubectl!
#
# Usage:
#   1. Set EMAIL in .env file
#   2. Run: ./scripts/apply-cert-manager.sh
#
# The script will substitute ${EMAIL} with the actual value from .env
#
# IMPORTANT: Always test with staging issuer first to avoid Let's Encrypt rate limits!
# After staging certificates work, switch ingresses to use letsencrypt-prod
